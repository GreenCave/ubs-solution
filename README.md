# Supermarket checkout component

This supermarket checkout component calculates the total price of a number of items.

Checkout mechanism can scan items and return actual price (is stateful).

Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multi-priced: "buy n of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you y cents".
